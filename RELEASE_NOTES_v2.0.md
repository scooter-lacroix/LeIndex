# Release Notes v2.0 (Historical marker)

This file previously contained Python-era release notes and migration instructions.

Current LeIndex repository/runtime is Rust-based, and active installation/usage guidance is documented in:

- `INSTALLATION.md`
- `RELEASE_NOTES.md`
- `docs/MIGRATION.md`
- `docs/RELEASE_BINARY_WORKFLOW.md`

If you are migrating from very old local environments, use `docs/MIGRATION.md` and rebuild indexes with current `leindex` binaries.
