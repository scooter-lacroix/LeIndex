## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Phased Approach:** Breaking work into phases made progress measurable
2. **Test-First:** Writing tests alongside code improved quality
3. **Documentation:** Continuous documentation prevented knowledge loss
4. **Performance Focus:** Early performance optimization prevented bottlenecks
5. **Security-First:** Security considerations from day 1 paid off

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Memory Management:** Accurate tracking required multiple iterations
2. **Thread Safety:** Concurrent access required careful lock design
3. **Configuration Migration:** Backward compatibility was complex
4. **Test Stability:** Some tests had timing issues requiring adjustments

### Improvements for Future Tracks
1. **Performance Tests:** Set up performance test infrastructure earlier
2. **Log Redaction:** Implement comprehensive redaction from the start
3. **Large-Scale Testing:** Test with larger projects earlier
4. **Documentation Automation:** Generate API docs from code
