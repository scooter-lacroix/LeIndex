## [x] Track: Fix Critical MCP Tool Bugs ✅ COMPLETE
*Link: [./maestro/tracks/mcp_bugs_fix_20260110/](./maestro/tracks/mcp_bugs_fix_20260110/)*

**Description:** Fix 6 critical bugs in the LeIndex MCP server causing runtime errors across core functionality (dashboard, search, cross-project search, project listing, memory eviction).

**Status:** Complete

**Completion Date:** 2026-01-10

**Commits:**
- df9e3c7: Add average_health_score and total_size_mb to DashboardData
- c5b6d6b: Correct parameter names in get_dashboard and list_projects
- eb6cb82: Correct parameter names in search_content and cross_project_search_tool
- 15af0e8: Register eviction unloader with thread-safe implementation

**Test Results:** 909 passed, 18 failed (pre-existing issues)

## [x] Track: Timeout Root Cause Fixes with Activity-Based Monitoring ✅ COMPLETE
*Link: [./maestro/archive/timeout_fix_20260111/](./maestro/archive/timeout_fix_20260111/)*

**Description:** Fixed root causes of 7 timeout-prone MCP operations. All operations now complete successfully without hanging.

**Status:** Complete

**Completion Date:** 2026-01-11

**Commits:**
- 0968507: Fix root causes of 7 timeout-prone MCP operations (all 7 operations fixed)

**Key Achievements:**
- Fixed lock release bug in manage_operations
- Converted blocking operations to async (search_content, manage_memory, manage_temp, detect_orphaned_indexes)
- Added async file I/O for configure_memory
- Implemented symlink loop detection in orphan detector
- Fixed 30+ tests to use async/await patterns
- Resolved 17 DuckDB locking errors in tests
- **Tzar Approved:** Code quality and architecture validated by codex-reviewer
- Test Results: 974 passed, 4 skipped, 0 errors

**Note:** Activity-based timeout enforcement (60s idle detection) was deferred per user direction - root cause fixes were the priority.

**Affected Operations:**
- detect_orphaned_indexes ✅
- search_content (find action) ✅
- manage_operations (list action) ✅
- get_diagnostics (operations, settings types) ✅
- configure_memory ✅
- manage_memory (cleanup action) ✅
- manage_temp (check action) ✅

## [x] Track: Fix Critical Search Bugs - Parameter Mismatch and InvalidPatternError
*Link: [./maestro/tracks/search_bug_fix_20260117/](./maestro/tracks/search_bug_fix_20260117/)*

**Description:** Fix two critical bugs:
1. Bug #1: `search_content` passes unsupported parameters (`content_boost`, `filepath_boost`, `highlight_pre_tag`, `highlight_post_tag`) to `search_code_advanced()` which doesn't accept them
2. Bug #2: `cross_project_search_tool` accesses non-existent `.message` attribute on `InvalidPatternError`, causing `AttributeError`

**Status:** New
